New York Times Article Page by William Xia

Description:
This project is a clone of an article page on the NYT website. The original can be found here: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html

What I Learned:
In this project I learned to semantically group elements. I used an article tag for the main article, while putting the side stuff in an aside tag. I also used figure and nav tags to display figures and navigational links, respectively. 

I learned it is important to use semantic tags to divide up your code. Not only it is important for self organization, but some screen readers use it to assist the handicapped so they may navigate more clearly.
